# Youtube Video Player Embed

## About:
I was having an issue where youtube videos only play the first 10 seconds(might be because of adblock.) 
The thing is, youtube embed links still worked fine.
So this extension will replace the video player on youtube.com with the embed player 

## Installation: 
1. download the repository through the [releases page](https://github.com/bluer222/youtubeVideoplayerEmbed/releases/latest)
2. extract the zip
3. open chrome://extensions and enable developer mode at the top right
4. load the folder using the "load unpacked" button at the top left

## Use:
The extension will do its thing without interaction.

After a few seconds Youtube notices the player is missing and tries to insert it again so after a few seconds the player will reset but it seems like it only happens once.
